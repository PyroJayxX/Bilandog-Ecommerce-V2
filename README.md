# Bilandog-Ecommerce-V2

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

(NOT YET RESPONSIVE FOR MOBILE VIEW)

Remastered version of Bilandog website I made from 2021.

Created for the purpose of practicing ReactJS with NextJS framework and Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

First, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
